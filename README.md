# HeatFlowSim
This project simulates 1D heat conduction in a metal rod using the finite difference method (FDM). It models heat distribution over time, visualizing temperature profiles under specific boundary conditions. Implemented in Python with numpy and matplotlib, it offers insights into thermal dynamics and heat transfer in mechanical systems.
